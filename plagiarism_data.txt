1	There are several different ways to write a program. One way is to use a functional programming style, which emphasizes the use of functions and avoids mutable data. Another way is to use an object-oriented programming style, which emphasizes the use of objects and mutable data. A third way is to use a procedural programming style, which emphasizes the use of procedures and modularity.
0	In this paper, we present a new algorithm for computing the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. Our algorithm is based on Dijkstra's algorithm, but it uses a more efficient data structure for storing the distances to the nodes.
1	Web search engines have become an essential tool for finding information on the Internet. However, the quality of search results can vary greatly depending on the search engine used and the query entered. In this paper, we propose a new ranking algorithm that takes into account the relevance of web pages as well as the authority of the websites they belong to.
0	We consider the problem of computing the intersection of two sets of points in the plane. Our algorithm is based on a divide-and-conquer strategy that recursively splits the sets into smaller subsets until they can be easily intersected. We show that our algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the total number of points in the two sets.
1	Plagiarism is a serious problem in academia, and many techniques have been developed to detect and prevent it. In this paper, we review some of the most commonly used plagiarism detection techniques, including text-based and feature-based methods. We also propose a new technique that combines both approaches and achieves higher accuracy than either method alone.
